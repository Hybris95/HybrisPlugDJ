How to use
----------
Copy/paste the script into the Console of your WebBrowser

javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/Hybris95/HybrisPlugDJ/master/hybrisPlugDJ.js');}());

Users can load the following UserScript into GreaseMonkey :

https://rawgit.com/Hybris95/HybrisPlugDJ/master/hybrisPlugDJ.user.js

Firefox issues
--------------
Firefox blocks mixed-content by default.

To enable it, type "about:config" in Firefox's address bar.

Then search for "security.mixed_content.block_active_content".

And set it to false (by double clicking on it).

TODO
----
Create a tag in the webpage for the audio instead of using mixed_content in javascript.
